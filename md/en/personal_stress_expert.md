Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder - Causes
=======================================

What happens if people don?t heal within the weeks following the trauma?

Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) develops in about 1 in 3 people
who experience severe trauma. Certain factors such as if you or your
family have had depression or anxiety in the past, or you don't receive
much support from family or friends, can make you more susceptible to
developing PTSD after a traumatic event.

In most cases, PTSD develops during the first month after a traumatic
event. However, in a minority of cases, there may be a delay of months
or even years before symptoms start to appear.
