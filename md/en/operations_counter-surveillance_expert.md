Countering Physical Surveillance
================================

Physical surveillance continues to be a significant danger to those
working on human rights. Other than a human source, it is the only way
to build detail on what is occurring at meetings. It is obviously
important to know how to identify if you, your colleagues, or partners
are under surveillance.

Counter-surveillance is the process of detecting and mitigating hostile
surveillance. This lesson lets you know how to practice
counter-surveillance at one of the most important times ? when you are
in a vehicle, such as going to a sensitive meeting.

For advice on how to practice counter-surveillance when on foot, go to
