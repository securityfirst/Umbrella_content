If travelling, you should first follow the advice outlined in the
Preparation lesson.

This lesson focuses specifically on how to cross borders if travelling
for sensitive work or with sensitive information. In establishing the
potential risk and risk mitigation measures for crossing borders, it is
important to establish a few basics about the reasons for, and possible
sensitivities of, your trip. It is vital to be aware of the nature of
the information you will be carrying into and out of the country, and
how you will carry it.

Sensitive or revealing information you may carry could include:

-   Data on people at risk/HRDs you are meeting
-   Travel plansPasswords/ access codes
-   Censored/ banned information
-   Organisation sensitive information
-   Personal information
-   Embarrassing/ incriminating information
-   Legal - encryption or data not allowed for export
-   Receipts
-   Reports

This information may be stored in/on notebooks, publications, laptops,
phones, USBs, CDs, or SD cards.

Remember:

-   Only minimal data should be brought with you
-   Bring a ?clean? laptop and phone if possible
-   Carry sensitive information and electronic equipment in hand
    luggage, as at least you know If it has been tampered with
-   Small, encrypted USB sticks or Micro SD cards can be useful for
    security and being able to hide sensitive data if necessary. See the
    Protecting Files lesson for advice on how to encrypt files.
-   Bring a cheap notebook in which you can rip out the pages unnoticed
-   Tamper proof Scotch tape can be useful for enhancing the security of
    your equipment, hotel safe, laptop ports etc.
