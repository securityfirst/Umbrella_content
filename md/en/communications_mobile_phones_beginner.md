The Problem with Mobile Phones
==============================

Mobile phones are basically insecure:

1.  Information sent from a mobile phone is vulnerable
2.  Information stored on a mobile phone is vulnerable
3.  Mobile phones give out information about their location
4.  Mobile phones can be used to eavesdrop

Not only can the company that runs your mobile phone network intercept
your calls and text messages (if unencrypted), and monitor your location
? many companies also choose, or are required, to share this information
with governments if asked.

Here, we'll describe some of vulnerabilities you need to be aware of
when using mobile phones of any type, and recommend ways you can stay a
bit safer.
