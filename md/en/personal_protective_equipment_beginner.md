Grab bags are bags filled with an individual?s survival essentials in
case they need to move rapidly. They should be prepared for high-risk
activists, journalists and humanitarians at times of heightened risk and
kept close to an exit in their residence ? somewhere easy to grab and
run.

You should plan out several potential escape routes in case of
emergency. Remember that the best escape route may vary depending on the
time of day (e.g. across the roof at night-time, via a garden fence in
the day time) so it is important to move the location of the grab bags
as necessary.
