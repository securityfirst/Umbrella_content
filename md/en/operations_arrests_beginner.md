Prevention
==========

Human rights workers, journalists and humanitarian staff are sometimes
arrested or detained. The risk of this happening can be significantly
reduced by:

-   Good relations with local authorities and groups where possible
-   Appropriate behaviour, on and off duty
-   Obeying local laws and customs
-   Ensuring that all legal documentation is correct, and carried by all
    staff and vehicles as required
-   Training and briefing staff before they begin their assignments

Be aware of which areas and groups benefit from aid and which do not,
and therefore might feel discriminated against, and make sure that as
many people as possible in the area of operations understand your
organisation and the role it is playing. Transparency, good
communications, integrity, even-handedness and respectful attitudes help
as well.
