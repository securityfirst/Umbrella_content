Radios are an insecure method of communication and should not be used
for senstive communication if at all possible. If possible, use
alternative options as outlined in the [Making a Call
lesson](umbrella://lesson/making-a-call). However many in the
humanitarian field still need to use them sometimes. If necessary,
develop a system of code words between those communicating so that your
message will not be so easily understood.
