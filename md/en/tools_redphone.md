Once you have registered your mobile number, RedPhone will send you an
SMS code to verify that the number belongs to you. Type in the code when
prompted by the app. You have now successfully installed RedPhone and
are ready to make encrypted calls!

### 2.0 Using RedPhone

In order to use RedPhone, the person that you are calling must also have
RedPhone (or Signal) installed. If you try to call someone using the
RedPhone app and they do not have it installed, the app will ask if you
would like to invite them to use RedPhone via SMS, but it will not allow
you to complete your call from inside the app.

When you make a call to another RedPhone or Signal user (from either
your default system dialer or from inside the app), you will be given a
random pair of words. This word pair will allow you to verify your
identity and keys with the other user?also known as key verification.

The trustworthiest way to verify the identity of a caller is to use
out-of-band authentication to verify the word pair. You can also read
the words aloud if you recognize the caller?s voice, although very
sophisticated attackers might be able to defeat this if they needed to.
The word pair must be identical.
