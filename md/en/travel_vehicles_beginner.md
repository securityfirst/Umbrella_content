Vehicle-related accidents are the major cause of injuries and fatalities
among aid personnel. Driving in unfamiliar and sometimes difficult
conditions can increase the likelihood of an accident. Other dangers
include ambush, robbery and aggressive behaviour of armed personnel at
checkpoints. If available and practical, all staff members should
receive driver safety training.

The most important piece of security advice an aid worker or human
rights defender can be given is ALWAYS WEAR A SEATBELT.

Driving Guidelines

-   Park in well-lit, heavily populated areas. Close all windows and
    lock doors before leaving the vehicle. Have keys ready in hand when
    returning to vehicle. Check the back seat before entering.
-   Immediately lock doors upon entry. Open windows no more than 5 cm
    and only those windows near occupied seats.
-   Do not speed or drive too fast for conditions. Observe local driving
    laws and regulations.
-   Avoid night driving or driving alone where possible.
-   Avoid letting the fuel tank fall below half full.
-   Keep a spare vehicle key in the office.
-   Never voluntarily carry unauthorized passengers,
    especially soldiers. However, if threatened, provide
    the transportation. In the event of an attempted carjacking, you
    should not risk your life to save a vehicle.
