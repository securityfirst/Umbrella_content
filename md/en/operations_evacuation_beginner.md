Evacuation planning and rehearsals should be carried out regularly.
Security situations can deteriorate rapidly, often without warning. The
evacuation plan should be prepared and all staff should understand an
outline of it. The following issues should be considered when preparing
your evacuation plan.

-   **Under what circumstances will you evacuate?** Outline the
    situations and indicators under which you will put this evacuation
    plan into action. Identify the situations under which you will:
    -   **Suspend** work activities in response to security concerns;
    -   **Hibernate** by staff remaining where they are but keeping a
        low profile;
    -   **Relocate** with staff moving internally within the country or
        to a safe-house to escape security concerns, or;
    -   **Evacuate** with staff stopping work and leaving the country
        due to severe security concerns.
-   **Who will be evacuated** - It is essential that all staff members
    clearly understand their and their families? eligibility for
    evacuation or relocation assistance.
    -   **Priority 1** ? International staff family members
    -   **Priority 2** ? Staff members who are in immediate personal
        danger due to the conditions of the crisis
    -   **Priority 3** ? Individuals other than essential staff
    -   **Priority 4** ? Essential staff
-   **Where will staff be evacuated to?**Identify a first-choice
    destination and an alternate destination for evacuation
    or relocation. Organise an emergency safe-house or safe-haven
    if needed. Determine visa requirements, and the logistics that will
    be needed upon arrival.
-   **How will staff be evacuated?**Establish a notification system and
    an assembly point. Detail the route and method of evacuation. Check
    to ensure that these routes can be travelled under
    emergency conditions. Coordinate plans with embassies, UN agencies,
    and other NGOs as appropriate.
-   **What goes and what stays?**Identify which documents, such as
    contracts, payroll records, etc. will be needed to re-establish
    operations once relocated or upon re-entry. Other documents should
    be marked for destruction, or left behind, as appropriate. Consider
    how evacuated documents will be perceived if seized by a particular
    person or group. They may contain information that could put those
    evacuating at risk, and would be better destroyed.
-   **Who is responsible for the various tasks during an evacuation?**
    During crises key staff will be fully occupied so responsibilities
    for evacuation should be clearly defined during the planning stage.
-   **What will be the expected impact of evacuation on the
    operation?**Will the office be closed and, if so, how? What are the
    policies and plans for continuing operations through national staff
    members acting on their own? Or through contractors, if feasible and
    appropriate?
