Why back-up?
============

Backing up is the copying and archiving of computer data so it can
retrieve it if something happens to the original. Years of work can
disappear in an instant as a result of theft, carelessness,
confiscation, or breakage, so it is extremely important to have an
up-to-date backup and a well-tested means of restoring it.

Creating an effective backup policy can be tricky for a few reasons:

-   The need to store original data and backups in different physical
    locations;
-   The importance of keeping backups confidential;
-   The challenge of coordinating among different people who share
    information with one another using their own portable
    storage devices.

In addition to backup and file-recovery tactics, this lesson addresses
two specific tools, Cobian Backup and Recuva.
