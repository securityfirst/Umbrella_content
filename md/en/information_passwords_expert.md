Threats of Physical Harm
========================

Finally, understand that there is always one way that attackers can
obtain your password: They can directly threaten you with physical harm
or detention. If you fear this may be a possibility, such as if you are
going to be travelling across hostile borders with sensitive
information, consider ways in which you can hide the existence of the
data or device you are password-protecting, rather than trust that you
will never hand over the password. One possibility is to maintain at
least one computer/email/keepass account that contains largely
unimportant information, whose password you can reveal quickly.

If you have good reason to believe that someone may threaten you for
your passwords, it's good to make sure your devices are configured so
that it won't be obvious that the account you are revealing is not the
?real? one. Is your real account shown in your computer's login screen,
or automatically displayed when you open a browser? If so, you may need
to reconfigure things to make your account less obvious.

In such circumstances, you should also treat your password manager as a
sensitive file, and hide/protect it as we describe in the [Protecting
Files lesson](umbrella://lesson/protecting-files).

Challenging password demands
============================

In some jurisdictions, such as the United States or Belgium, you may be
able to legally challenge a demand for your password. In other
jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom or India, local laws allow the
government to demand information is given to them. More information on
safety precautions to take while travelling can be read in the
[Journeys](umbrella://lesson/journeys) lesson.

Please note that intentional destruction of evidence or obstruction of
an investigation can be charged as a separate crime, often with very
serious consequences. In some cases, this can be easier for the
government to prove and allow for more substantial punishments than the
alleged crime originally being investigated.
