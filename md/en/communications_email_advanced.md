What is PGP?
============

If your threat model includes a government or law enforcement, or you
have some other reason for wanting to make sure that your email provider
is not able to turn over the contents of your email communications to a
third party, you may want to consider using end-to-end encryption for
your email communications. End-to-End Encryption is uninterrupted
protection of data traveling between two communicating parties.

PGP is the standard for end-to-end encryption of your email. PGP stands
for Pretty Good Privacy. It's actually very good privacy. If used
correctly, it can protect the contents of your messages, text, and even
files from being understood even by well-funded government surveillance
programs.
