Keeping your webmail private ? HTTPS
====================================

There are a few important steps that you can take in order to increase
the security of your email communication. The first is to make sure that
only the person to whom you send a given message is able to read it.

Keeping your webmail private ? HTTPS
------------------------------------

HTTPS, (also referred to as SSL or TLS), encrypts your communications so
that it cannot be read by other people on your network. This can include
the other people using the same Wi-Fi in an airport or at a café, the
other people at your office or school, the administrators at your ISP,
malicious hackers, governments, or law enforcement officials.
Communications sent over your web browser, including the web pages that
you visit and the content of your emails, using HTTP rather than HTTPS
are very easy for an attacker to intercept and read.

Most email providers give you a way of accessing your email using a web
browser, such as Firefox or Chrome. Of these providers, most of them
provide support for HTTPS. You should always make sure that your
connection is secure before logging in, reading your email, or sending a
message. You can tell that your email provider supports HTTPS if you log
in to your webmail and the URL at the top of your browser begins with
the letters HTTPS instead of HTTP (for
example: https://mail.google.com).

If your email provider supports HTTPS, but does not do so by default,
try replacing HTTP with HTTPS in the URL and refresh the page. If you?d
like to make sure that you are always using HTTPS on sites where it is
available, download the [HTTPS
Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) browser add-on for
Firefox or Chrome.

Webmail providers that use HTTPS by default include Gmail, RiseUp and
Yahoo.

Some webmail providers give you the option of choosing to use HTTPS by
default by selecting it in your settings, such as Hotmail.

HTTPS is the most basic level of encryption for your web browsing that
we recommend for everybody. It is as basic as putting on your seat belt
when you drive.
