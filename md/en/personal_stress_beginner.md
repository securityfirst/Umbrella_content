Types of Stress
===============

Stress is a natural reaction, and it can be positive and stimulating.
Not all stress is bad. There are different types of stress, both healthy
and unhealthy. Healthy stress helps people focus on the task at hand,
mobilises energy and prepares them for action. When stress occurs too
often, however, or is too intense or lasts too long, it turns from
positive to negative.

There are 3 different types of unhealthy stress: chronic, traumatic, and
also post-traumatic.\
\
1. Chronic stress is a combination of stress factors that builds up over
time, eroding our resilience and ability to work or function
effectively. This type of stress is dealt with below in the beginner?s
lesson.\
\
Traumatic stress results from directly experiencing, or being otherwise
closely exposed to, traumatic events or incidents that are life-
threatening or involve physical and emotional loss. It is dealt with in
the Advanced lesson\
\
Post-traumatic stress is prolonged stress which can occur months or even
years after an event. It is dealt with in the Expert lesson.\
\
People who have been trained about stress responses often react better
under stress because they understand what is happening to them.

Each person will experience stress differently and therefore must manage
their stress in their own way. Stress management varies by culture,
gender, personality, identity and many other factors.
