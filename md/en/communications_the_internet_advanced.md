Anonymity Online
================

Accessing information on the Internet, or publishing material online
such as photos or videos, leaves many traces of who and where you are
and what you are doing. This may put you at risk. You can reduce your
risks through the use of anonymising tools such as Tor.

**Remember, these tools can only protect your anonymity if you do not
log in to sites or post something online that could identify you!**
