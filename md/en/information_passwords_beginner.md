Passwords are often the first and only barrier between your information
and anyone who might want to read, use or destroy it without your
permission.

In general, when you want to protect something - whether a house or an
email account - you lock it up with a key. All keys, physical and
electronic, have one thing in common: they open their locks just as
effectively in the hands of somebody else. You can use the most advanced
security tools, but if your password is weak, or if you allow it to fall
into the wrong hands, they will not do you any good.

How to make a strong password
=============================

A password should be difficult for a computer program to guess,
difficult for others to figure out, and should be chosen so as to
minimise damage if someone does learn it.

-   **Make it long:** The longer a password is, the longer takes to
    guess it. Use more than ten characters or ideally a long phrase
    or sentence. Short passwords of any kind, even totally random
    ones, are not strong enough for use with encryption today.
-   **Make it complex:** Include upper case letters, lower case letters,
    numbers and symbols.
-   **Don't make it personal:** Don't choose a word or phrase based on
    information such as your name, telephone number, child's name, pet's
    name, birth date, or anything else that a person could learn by
    doing a little research about you.\
    ? Keep it secret: Do not share your password with anyone unless it
    is absolutely necessary. If you must share a password with a family
    member or colleague, you should change it to a temporary password
    first, share that one, then change it back when they are done
    using it. Often, there are alternatives to sharing a password, such
    as creating a separate account for each individual who needs access.
    Keeping your password secret also means not allowing anyone to see
    you typing it in.
-   **Make it unique:** Avoid using the same password for more than
    one account. Otherwise, anyone who learns that password will gain
    access to even more of your sensitive information.
-   **Keep it fresh:** Change your password on a regular basis, at least
    once every three months. The longer you keep one password, the more
    opportunity others have to figure it out and use it.
-   **Make it memorable:** If you have to write your password down
    because you can't remember it, you may end up facing a whole new
    category of threats that could leave you vulnerable to anybody with
    access to your work area. If you are unable to think of a password
    that is long and complex but still memorable, the remembering secure
    passwords section, below, might be of some help. If not, you should
    still choose something secure, but you may need to record it using a
    secure password database such as
    [KeePass](umbrella://lesson/keepassx), outlined in our
    Advanced section. Other types of password-protected files, including
    Microsoft Word documents, should not be trusted for this purpose, as
    many of them can be broken in seconds using tools that are freely
    available on the internet.

Remembering secure passwords
============================

There are a few tricks that might help you create passwords that are
easy to remember but very difficult to guess.

-   **Vary capitalisation, such as:** 'My naME is Not MR. MarSter'
-   **Alter numbers and letters, such as:** 'a11 w0Rk 4nD N0 p14Y'
-   **Incorporate symbols, such as:** 'c@t(heR1nthery3'
-   **Use multiple languages, such as:** 'Let Them Eat 1e gateaU au
    ch()colaT'
-   **Use acronyms:** 'Are you happy today?' becomes 'rU:-)2d@y?'

A little effort to make the password more complex goes a very long way.
Increasing the length of a password even just by a few characters, or by
adding numbers or special characters, makes it much more difficult to
crack.

Security Questions
==================

Be aware of the ?security questions? (such as ?What is your mother?s
maiden name?? or "What was your first pet's name?") that websites use to
confirm your identity if you do forget your password. Honest answers to
many security questions are publicly discoverable facts that a can be
easily found, and therefore bypass your password entirely. Instead, give
fictional answers that, like your password, no one knows but you. For
example, if the password question asks you your pet?s name, you may have
posted photos to photo sharing sites with captions such as ?Here is a
photo of my cute cat, Spot!? Instead of using ?Spot? as your password
recovery answer, you might choose ?Rumplestiltskin.?
