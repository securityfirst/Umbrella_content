Keep what you need
==================

The most basic rule for managing information securely is that any
information that could put people at risk should always be
compartmentalised and kept ?need to know?. This means that only those
people who really need that piece of information to operate should be
given it. For example, if a team is working with a high-risk source,
only the source?s direct contact within the team should have his or her
real name and details ? the rest of the team can operate using a code
name. This reduces the risk for both the source and those other members
of the team.

If there is not a good reason to keep a piece of sensitive information
then you should simply delete it (see the [Safely Deleting
lesson](umbrella://lesson/safely-deleting)).
