### 1.1 Things you should know about this tool before you start

Orbot provides Android devices with access to the Tor Network. Form more
information see the **[Internet
lesson](umbrella://lesson/the-internet)**

### 2.0 How to Install Orbot

**Step 1:** On your Android device, download and install the app from
the [Google Play store
here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.torproject.android).

 ![](tool_orbot2.png)

**Step 2:** Before the installation process begins, you will be prompted
to review the access the application will have on your phone. Review
this carefully. Once you are happy with the permissions that will be
granted, press ?Accept? and the installation will complete. If you do
not agree with the permissions that will be granted, press the back
button and the installation will be cancelled.

### 2.1 How to Configure Orbot

Using Orbot for the first time

**Step 1:** To open Orbot you tap the application's icon.

![](tool_orbot3.png)

**Step 2:** Tap the language that you want and then tap ?Next?.

**Step 3:** A configuration wizard will appear with a description of
Orbot. Read it and tap ?Next?.

**Step 4:** You will then be presented with a warning screen. Once you
have read this and understand the requirements tap ?Next?.

![](tool_orbot4.png)

**Step 5:** A screen will appear asking you to grant Orbot Superuser
access. Superuser access requires that your device is rooted if you want
to make use of Orbot's Transparent Proxy features - we will not explore
this feature in the Orbot guide. (For information about rooting your
phone, see the **[Mobile Phones, Expert
lesson](umbrella://lesson/mobile-phones)**.)

If your smartphone is not rooted, just tick the option that states *I
understand and would like to continue without Superuser*. The next
screen explains in order for you to benefit from Tor, you will need to
use apps built to work with Orbot, or that support HTTP or SOCKS proxy.

![](tool_orbot5.png)

**Step 6:** A list of applications that work with Orbot will appear.
Take note of them and tap ?Next?.

![](tool_orbot6.png)

**Step 7:** Orbot configuration is now complete. A final screen
describing the typical users of Tor and Orbot will appear, once you have
read this tap ?Finish?.

![](tool_orbot7.png)

**Step 8:** After pressing ?Finish? you will be presented with the
deactivated Orbot screen.

screen until it turns yellow and says *Orbot is starting*.

### 3.0.2 Browsing the internet anonymously

In order to browse or chat on the internet anonymously, you need to
install an app which can route your browsing through a proxy in
conjunction with Orbot. This is what Orbweb, the tool outlined below
will do for you.

### 3.1 Advanced Usage

### 3.1.1 New Identity

If at any stage you want to appear to come from a new location, you can
get a *new identity* from Orbot by swiping *left* or *right* on the
green Orbot image. The image will briefly spin and then display *You've
switched to a new Tor Identity*.

![](tool_orbot12.png)

### 3.1.2 Using Bridges

If Tor access is restricted or illegal in your country, or you wish to
disguise the fact that you are using Tor, you can configure Orbot to
use bridges.

**Step 1:** Tap the icon with three staggered dots at the top of the
screen to be brought to the settings screen.

**Step 2:** Scroll down to the bridges section and check the box next
to Use Bridges.

**Step 3:** Tap the Bridges section underneath *Use Bridges* to be
presented with a screen to enter the *IP address* of the *bridge* you
want to use. Once correctly entered, tap ?OK?. Restart Orbot to begin
using the *bridge*.

**ORWEB**

![](tool_orbot16.png)

### 1.1 Things you should know about this tool before you start

Orweb is a free Android-platform mobile phone application, created by
the Guardian Project for browsing the internet anonymously in
conjunction with Orbot.

**Note:** There is a bug in the current version of Orweb (0.6.1 and
older) that may leak information about you, such as your IP address, to
the website owners if you are viewing HTML5 based videos. Orweb will
still allow you to circumvent censorship and prevent you from being
spied on by your Internet Service Provider (ISP) but we do not recommend
itto be used to view sites that may be considered hostile. For more
information on the issue see the developers' response.

Orweb will only work properly after installing and configuring Orbot.

Remember, if you previously created a mail or blog without using Orweb,
the site will still know your real location even if you return
using Orweb.

If you want stronger anonymity while using Orweb other steps need to be
taken including:

? Never access accounts made in your real name\
? Never give your personal data\
? Never do the same things that you do when not trying to be anonymous.

For an alternative that works with iOS on iPhones,
use [OnionBrowser](https://mike.tig.as/onionbrowser/).

### 2.0 How to Install Orweb

**Step 1:** On your Android device, download and install the app from
the [Google Play store
here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.guardianproject.browser)
by tapping ?Install?.

![](tool_orbot17.png)

**Step 2:** Before the installation process begins, you will be prompted
to review the access the application will have on your phone. Review
this carefully. Once you are happy with the permissions that will be
granted, press ?Accept? to start the installation. If you do not agree
with the permissions that will be granted, press the back button and the
installation will be cancelled.

**Step 3:** Once Orweb downloads and installation has completed, you can
press ?Open? to start the application.

### 3.0 Basic Usage

**Using Orweb for the first time**

**Step 1:** To open Orweb you tap the application's icon.

**Step 2:** Orweb will launch and automatically try to connect
to *https://check.torproject.org*, to ensure that its connection to
the Tor network is working. If it can connect, you will see a message
telling you that your *browser is configured to use Tor*. If
Orweb cannot connect to the website you will see an error message in the
browser. If this happens, it is suggested that you check that Orbot is
installed and running corectly on your android device if this happens.
