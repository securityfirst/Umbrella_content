your Android device\

### 1.1 Things you should know about this tool before you start

? ObscuraCam's automatic face-recognition does not *always* work, but
you can easily select and obscure faces manually.\
? On some versions of the Android operating system, the option to delete
the original media file does not work. If you rely on this option,
please check to make sure that you do not have ObscuraCam photos (with
visible faces!) somewhere on your device.\
? If you use ObscuraCam to send photos to yourself or to someone else,
the tool does not provide additional protection (such as end-to-end
encryption) for the photo in transit.\
? A tag is an area in the photo which has been obscured by one of
several methods ObscuraCam can use.

### 2.0 How to Install ObscuraCam

**Step 1.** On your Android device, download and install the app from
the [Google Play store
here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms) by
tapping ?Install?.

**Step 2:** Before the installation process begins, you will be prompted
to review the access that the application will have on your phone.
Review this carefully. Once you are happy with the permissions that will
be granted, press ?Accept? and the installation will complete. If you do
not agree with the permissions that will be granted, press the back
button and the installation will be cancelled.

**Step 3. Tap** Open to run the app for the first time

**Step 4:** Review the Terms of use and if you are happy with them
press ?Accept? to be brought to the main screen of ObscuraCam.

### 2.1 Using ObscuraCam to obscure photos

You can use ObscuraCam to hide some or all of the faces that appear in
your photos. It works on pictures that you take with the ObscuraCam app
itself, but you can also blur faces in other photos, as long as you have
a way to copy or move the image files onto your Android device.

### 2.1 Taking And Obscuring New Photos

To take a photo on your Android device without showing your subjects'
faces, perform the following steps:

**Step 1:** From the main screen of ObscuraCam tap ?New Picture?.

![](tool_obscura2.png)

**Step 2:** Your phone's camera app will open, take a photo as you
normally would.

**Step 3:** A screen with a preview of the photo you took will be
displayed. Tap the tick to proceed with obscuring the photo,
otherwise tap the x to discard the current photo and take another.

**Step 4:** ObscuraCam\*\* will attempt to identify faces automatically.

**Step 5:** If ObscuraCam can detect faces in the photo it will add an
image "tag" (a rectangle used to select content that should be hidden)
over the face and pixelate it. If ObscuraCam did not detect any faces or
you need to obscure additional areas on the photo, tap on the area to
add additional tags.

You will be asked whether you want to delete the original, unblurred,
image from your phone, if you no longer need the original photo
tap ?Yes? otherwise tap ?No? to save a copy of both the obscured and
unobscured photo.

### 2.1.2 Obscuring Existing Photos

**Step 1:** From the main screen of ObscuraCam tap ?Obscure Photo?.

**Step 2:** Browse to the file on your phone that you want to obscure.

**Step 3:** ObscuraCam will attempt to detect any faces in the image and
pixelate them.

**Step 4:** If ObscuraCam did not detect any faces or you want to
obscure additional faces or items in the photo tap the relevant area to
add additional pixelation.

**Step 5:** To see a preview of the photo you can tap the eye icon, to
return to the edit screen tap anywhere on the preview image.

**Step 6:** To share the obscured photo via an existing application on
your phone such as K-9 Mail or TextSecure tap the icon made up of a dot
with arrows.

**Step 7:** To save the blurred photo to your phone tap the save icon.
You will be asked whether you want to delete the original, unblurred,

tap ?Yes? otherwise tap ?No? to save a copy of both the obscured and
unobscured photo.

### 2.3 Modifying the "blur" mode

### 2.3.1 Resize or move the tag

While editing a photo in ObscuraCam, if you need to resize the tag,
touch one of the four corners of the white outline box so that it turns
green and drag it to make it larger or smaller.

If you need to move the tag so that it is in a better position on the
photo, touch the centre of the pixelated area so that the surrounding
white box turns green, then drag the box to the location you want.

### 2.3.2 Change the obscure type

ObscuraCam gives you a few options on how to obscure a photo. From the
edit screen tap on an existing obscured area to bring up the obscuring
options:

![](tool_obscura5.png)

**Pixelate** will obscure any part of the photo inside the tag by
pixelating it

![](tool_obscura6.png)

**Redact** will obscure any part of the photo inside the tag by placing
a black box over it

![](tool_obscura7.png)

**Mask** will obscure any part of the photo inside the tag by placing a
funny mask over the person

![](tool_obscura8.png)

**Crowd Pixel** will obscure any part of the photo *outside* the tag by
pixelating the rest of it.

![](tool_obscura9.png)

**Clear Tag** will remove the selected tag from the photo.

### 2.3 Obscuring Videos

Obscuracam can also obscure faces or objects in videos, however unlike
with photos it can only obscure existing photos that you took with your
phone or copied to your phone

### 2.3.1 Automatic Obscuring of Videos

**Step 1:** From the main screen of Obscuracam tap ?Obscure Video?.

**Step 2:** Select the video you with to obscure from your phones
storage

**Step 3:** Tap ?Yes? when asked *Would you like to detect faces in this
video*.

**Step 3:** The video will begin to play and ObscuraCam will attempt to
detect faces. The process for detecting faces takes approximately *4
seconds* for every *1 second* of the video.

**Step 4:** Once the face detection has completed, you can tap Play to
review the video. This will show you the pixelated tags over the faces
as well as a green trail showing the path the tag takes through the
video as the face moves.

![](tool_obscura10.png)

**Step 5:** After reviewing the video and you are happy that all faces
are obscured, tap the save icon at the top of the screen to save the
video to your phones storage.

**Note:** If ObscuraCam did not properly obscure faces or failed to
detect some, you can see how to manually obscure them in section below.

### 2.3.2 Manual Obscuring of Videos

If ObscuraCam was not able to detect faces properly during the automatic
process or you would like more process over the obscuring process you
can manually obscure video.

storage.

**Step 3:** Tap ?No? when asked *Would you like to detect faces in this
video*.

**Step 5:** While the video plays, touch and hold your finger on a face
in the video to add a tag over it, drag the tag around the screen with
your finger following the movement of the face. Lift your finger off the
screen to stop obscuring the video.

**Note:** As you follow the face on the screen you will see a green
trail being left behind, this is the path the pixelated tag will take
once the video is saved.

**Step 6:** If there are additional faces in the video that you wish to
obscure, touch and hold the blue circle and move the slider back to the
time point where the next face appears on video and repeat *step
5* above.

**Step 7:** Once you have finished manually obscuring faces, you can
tap the play icon to review the video. This will show you the pixelated
tags over the faces as well as a green trail showing the path the tag
takes through the video as the face moves.

**Step 8:** After reviewing the video and you are happy that all faces
are obscured, tap the save icon at the top of the screen to save the
video to your phones storage.

### 2.3.3 Changing Output Video Quality

ObscuraCam chooses a default video quality when saving that make the
video small enough to easily share via email or other methods but does
reduce resolution and quality of the video.

To keep the obscured video in a higher resolution:

**Step 1:** After either automatically or manually detecting faces and
before saving the video, tap the three vertical dots icon to bring up
the menu and select ?Preferences?.

possibly ObscuraCam will give you the range by which each setting can be
changed.

**Step 3:** Once you have made the desired output changes, tap the back
button on your phone and save the video.
