Regular phone calls
===================

When you make a call from a landline or a mobile phone, your call is not
end-to-end encrypted. If you're using a mobile phone, your call may be
weakly encrypted between your handset and the cell phone towers. However
as your conversation travels through the phone network, it's vulnerable
to interception by your phone company and, by extension, any governments
or organizations that have power over your phone company. There are also
inexpensive techniques which other people can use to listen to your
calls if they are close to your phone.
