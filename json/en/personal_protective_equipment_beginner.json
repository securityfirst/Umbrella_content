They should be prepared for high-risk activists, journalists and humanitarians at times of heightened risk and kept close to an exit in their residence ? somewhere easy to grab and run.</p><p>You should plan out several potential escape routes in case of emergency. Remember that the best escape route may vary depending on the time of day (e.g. across the roof at night-time, via a garden fence in the day time) so it is important to move the location of the grab bags as necessary.</p>",
