<p>Passwords are often the first and only barrier between your information and anyone who might want to read, use or destroy it without your permission.</p>
<p>In general, when you want to protect something - whether a house or an email account - you lock it up with a key. All keys, physical and electronic, have one thing in common: they open their locks just as effectively in the hands of somebody else. You can use the most advanced security tools, but if your password is weak, or if you allow it to fall into the wrong hands, they will not do you any good.</p>
