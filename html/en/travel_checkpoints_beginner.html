<p>Many checkpoints have a legitimate purpose, for example to prevent weapons from entering an area. Some checkpoints, however, are designed to harass people or as a cover for ambush, theft or violence. It is important to recognise the difference between a legal, sanctioned checkpoint and one designed for the gain of the checkpoint personnel.</p>
<p>You first need to rapidly assess the nature of the checkpoint.</p>
<ul>
<li>Where it is located?</li>
<li>Who is manning it?</li>
<li>What does their mood appear to be?</li>
<li>Are there any signs of trouble?</li>
</ul>
<p>Checkpoints at crossroads, bridges, mountain passes and town entrances and exits are to be expected, and are likely to have been set up for the general monitoring of all passers-by. Checkpoints in the middle of a forest or on a mountain road away from habitation may exist for a more ominous purpose. Checkpoints manned by regular army and police forces may be less problematic than ones manned by irregulars.</p>
<p>If you suspect that there is a risk of violence or other serious problems, turn round and drive steadily away, if it is safe to do so.</p>
<p>Before approaching or leaving a checkpoint, inform base by radio. Do so in a discreet way, far enough from the checkpoint to avoid them seeing that you are using the radio</p>
