<h1 id="why-back-up">Why back-up?</h1>
<p>Backing up is the copying and archiving of computer data so it can retrieve it if something happens to the original. Years of work can disappear in an instant as a result of theft, carelessness, confiscation, or breakage, so it is extremely important to have an up-to-date backup and a well-tested means of restoring it.</p>
<p>Creating an effective backup policy can be tricky for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The need to store original data and backups in different physical locations;</li>
<li>The importance of keeping backups confidential;</li>
<li>The challenge of coordinating among different people who share information with one another using their own portable storage devices.</li>
</ul>
