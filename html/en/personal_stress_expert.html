<p>What happens if people don?t heal within the weeks following the trauma?</p>
<p>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) develops in about 1 in 3 people who experience severe trauma. Certain factors such as if you or your family have had depression or anxiety in the past, or you don't receive much support from family or friends, can make you more susceptible to developing PTSD after a traumatic event.</p>
<p>In most cases, PTSD develops during the first month after a traumatic event. However, in a minority of cases, there may be a delay of months or even years before symptoms start to appear.</p>
