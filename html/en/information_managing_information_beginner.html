<p>The most basic rule for managing information securely is that any information that could put people at risk should always be compartmentalised and kept ?need to know?. This means that only those people who really need that piece of information to operate should be given it. For example, if a team is working with a high-risk source, only the source?s direct contact within the team should have his or her real name and details ? the rest of the team can operate using a code name. This reduces the risk for both the source and those other members of the team.</p>

<p>If there is not a good reason to keep a piece of sensitive information then you should simply delete it (see the <a href="umbrella://lesson/safely-deleting">Safely Deleting lesson</a>).</p>
