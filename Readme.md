Currently the only encoding in the app is .JSON files and the language is only English, but we hope this becomes a basis for translation to other languages.

This is the first export of Umbrella so there may be issues and inaccuracies, please report them to [info@secfirst.org](info@secfirst.org)

##Contributing Content and/or Translating

We are currently translating Umbrella into other languages. You can see our progress and volunteer to translate on our [Transifex] (https://github.com/securityfirst/Umbrella_content). Many thanks to the awesome team at the [Localization Lab] (http://www.localizationlab.org) for helping us conduct such as massive undertaking!

For more information, please see our [translator information document] (https://github.com/securityfirst/Umbrella_content/blob/master/TRANSLATION.md).

We are currently in the middle of making our content flow more efficient and are collaborating with a community project to make it easier to reuse. For more details on that, see [here] (https://iilab.github.io/contentascode/).
